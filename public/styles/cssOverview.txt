The css should likely be in one file at the end of this, but that file would be sorted like the files are sorted now, in that case.

GlobalStyles:
    - body
    - header 
    - button stylings
    - text styling
    - general slide div wrapper
    - div for login and signup 


General global should be in type selectors.
next level down from that ( several elms with same style differing from global) should be class and pseudoclass.
Then sprecific things should select by id.
