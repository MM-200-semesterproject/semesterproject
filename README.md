# MM200-Apputvikling-prosjekt

Semester project presentation tool
Presentation tools like Keynote, Powerpoint, Prezi and the like, are powerful tools with a lot
of complexity. There are other, less complicated tools like Slides.com and "Haiku Deck" that
achieves more or less the same thing.
This assignment is about creating a presentation tool for web/mobile more in line with the
simplicity of the later.
Active use of a clear agile development process and version control system is a project
requirement.
